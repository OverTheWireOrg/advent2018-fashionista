*The [OverTheWire Advent Bonanza 2018](https://advent2018.overthewire.org)
challenge for Friday 21 December 2018*

If, like me, you lack any sense of style, then today is a glorious day for you.<br>
Today is [Ugly Christmas Sweater
day](http://www.nationaluglychristmassweaterday.org/), a day when having a lack of style<br>is actually an advantage!

Today's challenge can yield two flags, because it has two independent parts:

### Part 1: Show us your ridiculous holiday outfit

Wear your ~~ugliest~~ most awesome holiday outfit and take a selfie with a<br>
note containing your teamname, "OverTheWire Advent2018" and season greetings of<br>
your choice.  Then, either post the selfie on twitter<br>
with hashtag [#NationalUglyChristmasSweaterDay](https://twitter.com/hashtag/NationalUglyChristmasSweaterDay)
and [@OverTheWireCTF](https://twitter.com/OverTheWireCTF) in CC,<br> or contact us
through IRC in case you have no twitter account.

### Part 2: Show us your heart

Although this holiday season is for many of us a happy occasion, let us<br>
not forget about all those that are less fortunate.

Contribute to any charity of your choosing, in any way that is helpful.<br>
Donating money is the easy way, but there are also a lot of other ways<br>
to help: donate clothes, toys, food, hugs or even your blood.<br><br>
Share a picture with some kind of evidence of your involvement, either on<br>
 twitter with hashtag [#FromTheHeart](https://twitter.com/hashtag/FromTheHeart) and
[@OverTheWireCTF](https://twitter.com/OverTheWireCTF) in CC,<br> or contact us
through IRC in case you have no twitter account.
